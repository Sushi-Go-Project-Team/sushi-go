            <p>The game takes place over 3 rounds. To start a round, all players simultaneously choose any 1 card from their hands that they would like to keep and will get placed face-down in front of them. When each player has done this, everyone reveals their chosen cards.</p>

<p>After revealing each playerâ€™s cards, the remaining hand will be passed face-down to the player on your left. Everyone picks up their new hands and the next turn begins. You now have a new and smaller hand to choose from. Face-up cards remain with you until the end of the round, when they are scored. Once the final card is passed on, the scoring will begin.</p>

<p>To score, each player adds up all the points from the face-up cards. Each card has a different number of points depending on how many of each card you have. The player can view the rules of each card by clicking on them during the game.</p>

<p>Keep track of your scores from the previous round. A new round will begin and all the cards will be discarded. The only exceptions are Mochi cards which you keep in front of you to be scored at the end of the game. Every player will be handed 6 cards, equal to the amount from the last round.
